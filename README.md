# golang examples/tutorials

## more information can be found at [golang](https://golang.org) website.

### I will add tons of examples that progressively get more complicated.  I will also store examples of features of the standard library in these examples.  If you see any issues with anything please make a pull request.

### each example will be seperated by a line seperator like below:

***

### table of contents
* [hello world][1]

***

### hello world
[1]: abc
```
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
***
